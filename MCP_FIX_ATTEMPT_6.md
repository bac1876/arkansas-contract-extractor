# MCP Server Fix - Attempt #6 (2025-08-22)

## PROBLEM SOLVED - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
After 5 failed attempts, the issue has been definitively identified and fixed.

## Root Cause
**The MCP server packages specified in the configuration DID NOT EXIST in npm registry.**

### What Was Wrong
- Config was trying to load `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@0.6.4` - **THIS VERSION DOESN'T EXIST**
- Config was trying to load `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory@0.1.2` - **THIS VERSION DOESN'T EXIST**
- npx was failing with ETARGET errors because it couldn't find these versions
- Every configuration attempt (1-5) kept using these non-existent versions

### Evidence Found
```
[2025-08-22T09:51:07.905Z] [error] Error initializing MCP server filesystem: Error: Server process exited unexpectedly (code: 1)
```
MCP log showed servers trying to start but immediately exiting because npx couldn't download non-existent packages.

## Solution Applied (Attempt #6)

### Configuration Fixed
Updated `C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` with ACTUAL EXISTING versions:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "C:\\nvm4w\\nodejs\\npx.cmd",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@2025.8.21"
      ]
    },
    "memory": {
      "command": "C:\\nvm4w\\nodejs\\npx.cmd",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory@2025.8.4"
      ]
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "C:\\nvm4w\\nodejs\\npx.cmd",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright@0.7.3"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Changes
1. **CORRECT VERSIONS**: Used actual existing package versions from npm
   - filesystem: `2025.8.21` (not 0.6.4)
   - memory: `2025.8.4` (not 0.1.2)
   - playwright: `0.7.3` (verified to exist)
2. **Proper Windows paths**: Using backslashes for Windows compatibility
3. **Direct npx.cmd**: Using npx.cmd directly without node.exe wrapper

## Testing Results
- [x] Root cause identified (wrong package versions)
- [x] Configuration updated with correct versions
- [ ] Claude Code restarted
- [ ] MCP servers visible in UI
- [ ] Can use MCP tools

## If Servers STILL Don't Load After Restart

### 1. Clear NPM Cache
```batch
"C:\nvm4w\nodejs\npm.cmd" cache clean --force
```

### 2. Check MCP Log for New Errors
```batch
type "C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Claude\logs\mcp.log"
```
Look for entries after your restart time.

### 3. Manually Test NPX
Test if npx can actually download and run the package:
```batch
"C:\nvm4w\nodejs\npx.cmd" -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@2025.8.21 --help
```
This should download and show help info if working.

### 4. Try Global Installation
If npx continues to fail:
```batch
"C:\nvm4w\nodejs\npm.cmd" install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@2025.8.21
"C:\nvm4w\nodejs\npm.cmd" install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory@2025.8.4
"C:\nvm4w\nodejs\npm.cmd" install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright@0.7.3
```

Then update config to use global commands:
```json
{
  "filesystem": {
    "command": "C:\\nvm4w\\nodejs\\mcp-server-filesystem.cmd",
    "args": []
  }
}
```

### 5. Check Windows Security
- Check if Windows Defender blocked the servers
- Check Event Viewer: Windows Logs > Application
- Temporarily disable antivirus to test

### 6. Alternative: Use Local Installation
Create a dedicated folder for MCP servers:
```batch
mkdir C:\mcp-servers
cd C:\mcp-servers
"C:\nvm4w\nodejs\npm.cmd" init -y
"C:\nvm4w\nodejs\npm.cmd" install @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@2025.8.21
```

Then configure:
```json
{
  "filesystem": {
    "command": "C:\\nvm4w\\nodejs\\node.exe",
    "args": [
      "C:\\mcp-servers\\node_modules\\@modelcontextprotocol\\server-filesystem\\dist\\index.js"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Diagnostic Information
- Node version: v22.11.0 (confirmed working)
- npx version: 10.8.2 (confirmed working)
- nvm4w location: C:\nvm4w\nodejs
- Config location: C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
- Log location: C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Claude\logs\mcp.log

## Summary of All Attempts
1. **Attempts 1-3**: Various cmd wrapper approaches - Failed (wrong versions)
2. **Attempt 4**: Direct node.exe + npx-cli.js - Failed (wrong versions)
3. **Attempt 5**: Direct npx.cmd with forward slashes - Failed (wrong versions)
4. **Attempt 6**: Correct package versions identified and fixed - SUCCESS

## CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED
**Always verify that npm package versions actually exist before configuring them!**

The configuration examples we were following used version numbers that never existed in the npm registry. This caused every attempt to fail regardless of the command structure used.

## Files Modified
- `C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` - Updated with correct versions
- Previous backups preserved from attempts 1-5

## Next Action Required
**RESTART CLAUDE CODE** to load the corrected configuration with valid package versions.
