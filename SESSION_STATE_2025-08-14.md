# Session State - August 14, 2025

## Current Status
✅ **Email monitoring system fully operational**
✅ **Address matching fix implemented and working**
✅ **Property-specific tax and commission data pulling correctly from Google Sheet**

## What We Fixed Today

### 1. Address Matching Issue (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Properties weren't matching in Google Sheet because of address format differences
- Sheet had: "1199 Splash", "3312 Alliance"  
- Extracted: "1199 S Splash Dr, Fayetteville, AR", "3312 Alliance Dr, Springdale, AR"

**Solution**: Improved `listing-info-service.ts` with better address normalization:
- Removes directional prefixes (N/S/E/W)
- Removes street suffixes (Dr/St/Ave/Rd)
- Matches on street number + primary street name

**File Modified**: `listing-info-service.ts` (lines 77-138)

### 2. Title Insurance Calculation (PREVIOUSLY FIXED)
- Was using wrong column from rate table
- Fixed to use Option A = Lender's Policy, Option B = Owner's Policy
- File: `seller-net-sheet-calculator.ts`

### 3. Commission Percentage Format (PREVIOUSLY FIXED)
- Was treating 2.5% as 2.5 instead of 0.025
- Fixed by dividing by 100 when reading from Google Sheet
- File: `listing-info-service.ts` (line 69)

npm run email-monitor
```

## Known Issues

## Last Actions

- Tested with 1199 S Splash and 3315 Alliance - both working correctly
- Created `process-specific-email.ts` for testing individual emails
- System ready for production use

- `check-inbox-simple.ts` - Check inbox for new emails
- `process-specific-email.ts` - Process specific email by message ID
