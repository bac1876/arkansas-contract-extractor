# MCP Solution - Final Status (2025-08-22)

## ✅ SOLUTION FOUND

**The MCP servers are configured correctly but Claude Desktop isn't running.**

## What I Found

1. **Configuration**: ✅ CORRECT
   - The filesystem server has the required directory argument
   - All paths are correct
   - Previous fix from Attempt #9 was successful

2. **Server Testing**: ✅ WORKING
   - Filesystem server runs successfully
   - Memory server runs successfully
   - Playwright configuration is correct

3. **Claude Desktop**: ❌ NOT RUNNING
   - No Claude Desktop process found
   - Logs haven't updated since 2025-08-19
   - This is why MCP servers aren't available

## ACTION REQUIRED

### Start Claude Desktop:
1. Open the Claude Desktop application (not the browser)
2. The MCP servers will automatically start when Claude Desktop launches
3. You should then see MCP tools available

### How to Verify It's Working:
After starting Claude Desktop, you can:
- Check if MCP tools appear in the tool list
- Look for new entries in `C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Claude\logs\mcp.log`
- Try using an MCP tool

## Technical Details

The configuration in `C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` is correct:
- Filesystem server properly configured with directory argument
- Memory server configured correctly
- All paths point to `C:\nvm4w\nodejs\npx.cmd`

Manual tests confirm both servers work:
```bash
# Filesystem server - WORKS
C:/nvm4w/nodejs/npx.cmd -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@2025.8.21 "C:/Users/Owner/claude code projects"
# Output: "Secure MCP Filesystem Server running on stdio"

# Memory server - WORKS  
C:/nvm4w/nodejs/npx.cmd -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory@2025.8.4
# Output: "Knowledge Graph MCP Server running on stdio"
```

## Summary
No configuration changes needed. Just start Claude Desktop and the MCP servers will work.
