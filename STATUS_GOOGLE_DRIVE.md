# Google Drive Integration Status

## Current Status
✅ **Contract Extraction**: Working perfectly (96-98% accuracy)
✅ **Seller Net Sheet Calculation**: Working correctly
✅ **Google Sheets Tracking**: Working (saves to tracking spreadsheet)
✅ **Email Monitoring**: Working
✅ **Web Interface**: Working at http://localhost:3006

⏳ **Google Drive Individual Sheets**: Permission configuration in progress

## Google Drive Setup Progress

### Completed:
1. ✅ Created service account: `arkansas-contract-agent@arkansas-contract-agent.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
2. ✅ Downloaded service account key file
3. ✅ Enabled Google Drive API
4. ✅ Enabled Google Sheets API  
5. ✅ Added Editor role to service account in IAM
6. ✅ Implemented GoogleDriveIntegration class
7. ✅ Drive folders created successfully

### Issue:
- Getting "The caller does not have permission" error when creating Google Sheets
- This is likely due to IAM propagation delay (can take up to 7 minutes)

## Next Steps:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for IAM changes to fully propagate
2. Restart the server: `npm run server`
3. Test with: Upload a contract at http://localhost:3006

## Alternative Solutions If Permission Issues Persist:

### Option 1: Domain-Wide Delegation
If this is a Google Workspace account, enable domain-wide delegation for the service account.

### Option 2: Use OAuth2 Instead
Switch from service account to OAuth2 with user consent flow.

### Option 3: Share Existing Folder
1. Create a folder in your personal Google Drive
2. Share it with the service account email
3. Update the code to use that shared folder

## Current Workaround:
All net sheets are being saved locally in:
- JSON format: `processed_contracts/seller_net_sheets/`
- HTML format: `processed_contracts/seller_net_sheets/`

The system is fully functional except for the Google Drive individual sheet creation feature.
