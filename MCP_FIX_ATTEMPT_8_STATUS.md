# MCP Fix Attempt #8 - Status (2025-08-22)

## Current Progress
- ✅ Checked MCP configuration - paths are using Windows backslashes correctly
- ✅ Reviewed MCP logs - servers last disconnected on 2025-08-19
- ✅ Verified npx is available (version 10.8.2)
- ✅ Confirmed @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@2025.8.21 package exists

## Where We Left Off
Testing manual MCP server execution to see if the servers can start properly.

## Next Steps After Restart
1. Continue testing manual MCP server execution
2. Apply fix for attempt #8 based on findings
3. Verify MCP servers are working

## Key Findings So Far
- Configuration looks correct with Windows backslashes
- MCP servers haven't been running since 2025-08-19
- NPX and packages are accessible
- Need to determine why servers aren't starting with current config
