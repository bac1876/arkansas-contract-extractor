## Critical Fixes Applied (Oct 28, 2025)

### 1. ‚úÖ IMAP Authentication Issue (Email Password Expired)
**Problem:** App password for `offers@searchnwa.com` was revoked/expired
**Solution:** Generated new app password and updated Railway environment variable
**Impact:** Email monitoring now works, can receive contracts again

### 2. ‚úÖ Variable Scoping Bug - `netSheetData is not defined`
**Problem:** `netSheetData` declared inside conditional, used in separate block where out of scope
**Solution:** Moved `let netSheetData: any;` declaration before conditionals
**Files:** `email-monitor.ts:580`
**Impact:** Google Sheets tracking now works without errors

### 3. ‚úÖ Extraction Timeout (90s ‚Üí 300s)
**Problem:** 17-page PDF extraction timing out at 90s, causing 3-4 full retries (7-10 min total)
**Solution:** Increased timeout from 90s to 300s (5 minutes) to handle slower OpenAI API responses
**Files:** `extraction-robust.ts:45`
**Impact:** Processing time reduced from 7-10 min ‚Üí 1-2 min

### 4. ‚úÖ Google Sheets Column Limit Bug
**Problem:** Column letter conversion only worked for A-Z (0-25), failed at column 283
**Error:** `Unable to parse range: NetSheets![1:[35`
**Solution:** Added `columnIndexToLetter()` helper function to handle unlimited columns (A-Z, AA-ZZ, AAA+)
**Files:** `google-sheets-integration.ts:51-58, 251`
**Impact:** Net sheets tracking works with 283+ columns (JA, JB, etc.)

### 5. ‚úÖ Survey Formatting Bug
**Problem:** "Buyer declines survey" (Box B) showed as "Yes - Paid by Buyer" instead of hiding field
**Solution:** Fixed `formatSurvey()` logic - Option B now returns null (field hidden)
**Files:** `offer-summary-generator.ts:403-406`
**Impact:** Survey field only shows when there IS a survey (Box A)

### 6. ‚úÖ Fixtures Formatting Cleanup
**Problem:** Fixtures showing "n/a; NOT: n/a" when no fixtures to convey/exclude
**Solution:** Filter out "n/a" values, use line breaks instead of semicolons, return null when empty
**Files:** `offer-summary-generator.ts:415-430`
**Impact:** Professional appearance - field hidden when no fixtures

### 7. ‚úÖ Address Normalization Enhancement
**Problem:** Full legal description showing: "2300 Cottonwood Place, Springdale, AR 72762; LOT 1, BLOCK 8, WOODLAND HEIGHTS III, SPRINGDALE, WASHINGTON COUNTY, ARKANSAS"
**Solution:** Enhanced regex patterns to remove LOT/BLOCK, subdivision names, county suffixes
**Files:** `offer-summary-generator.ts:63-88`
**Impact:** Clean address display: "2300 Cottonwood Place, Springdale, AR 72762"
