You can upload multiple contracts and process them all at once.

  -F "contract=@your-contract.pdf"
```

### Batch Extraction
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/extract-batch \
  -F "contracts=@contract1.pdf" \
  -F "contracts=@contract2.pdf"
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "filename": "contract.pdf",
  "extractionRate": 95,
  "data": {
    "para1_buyers": ["John Doe", "Jane Doe"],
    "para1_property": "123 Main St, City, AR 72701",
    "para3_price": 250000,
    "para19": "B",
    // ... all other fields
  },
  "csv": "Field,Value\nBuyers,\"John Doe; Jane Doe\"\n..."
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Make sure you have Node.js installed
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Check that port 3000 is not in use

### Extraction Issues
- Ensure PDF is a valid Arkansas real estate contract
- File must be under 10MB
- PDF must be readable (not password protected)

### Para 19 Shows "Manual Review"
This happens when the pattern doesn't match expected format. The system will flag it for manual review rather than guessing incorrectly.

## üìû Support

For issues or questions, check the extraction logs in the terminal where you ran `npm start`.
