# MCP Final Solution - Working Configuration (2025-08-22)

## âœ… SOLUTION THAT WORKS

### Multiple Ways to Start Claude with MCP:

#### Option 1: Use the Batch File (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
C:\Users\Owner\start-claude.bat
```
Or just double-click `start-claude.bat` from Windows Explorer

#### Option 2: Use Command Line with Config
```bash
claude --mcp-config "C:\Users\Owner\claude-mcp-config.json"
```

#### Option 3: Use the Wrapper Commands
```bash
claude-mcp        # From .npm-global directory
claude-with-mcp   # From Users\Owner directory
```

## Files Created

### 1. Startup Scripts
- `C:\Users\Owner\start-claude.bat` - Main launcher (double-click to start)
- `C:\Users\Owner\claude-with-mcp.cmd` - Command line wrapper
- `C:\Users\Owner\.npm-global\claude-mcp.cmd` - NPM global wrapper

### 2. MCP Server Batch Files (Working)
- `C:\Users\Owner\mcp-filesystem.bat` - File operations
- `C:\Users\Owner\mcp-memory.bat` - Knowledge graph
- `C:\Users\Owner\mcp-playwright.bat` - Browser automation

### 3. Configuration Files
- `C:\Users\Owner\claude-mcp-config.json` - MCP server configuration
- `C:\Users\Owner\.claude\settings.local.json` - Claude settings (includes MCP)

### 4. Environment Variable Set
- `CLAUDE_MCP_CONFIG` = `C:\Users\Owner\claude-mcp-config.json`

## How to Verify MCP is Working

After starting Claude with any of the methods above:

1. Type `/mcp` in Claude Code
2. You should see:
   ```
   Available MCP servers:
   - filesystem: 6 tools available
   - memory: 5 tools available  
   - playwright: 6 tools available
   ```

## Available MCP Tools

### filesystem server:
- `mcp__filesystem__list_directory` - List files in a directory
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file` - Read file contents
- `mcp__filesystem__write_file` - Write to files
- `mcp__filesystem__create_directory` - Create directories
- `mcp__filesystem__move_file` - Move/rename files
- `mcp__filesystem__search_files` - Search for files

### memory server:
- `mcp__memory__create_entities` - Create knowledge entities
- `mcp__memory__create_relations` - Create relationships
- `mcp__memory__search_entities` - Search entities
- `mcp__memory__open_nodes` - Open knowledge nodes
- `mcp__memory__read_graph` - Read knowledge graph

### playwright server:
- `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` - Navigate to URLs
- `mcp__playwright__browser_screenshot` - Take screenshots
- `mcp__playwright__browser_click` - Click elements
- `mcp__playwright__browser_fill` - Fill form fields
- `mcp__playwright__browser_select` - Select dropdowns
- `mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate` - Run JavaScript

## Troubleshooting

### If MCP servers don't load:

1. **Check if batch files work:**
   ```bash
   echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"1.0.0"},"id":1}' | "C:/Users/Owner/mcp-filesystem.bat"
   ```
   Should output: "Secure MCP Filesystem Server running on stdio"

2. **Verify Node/NPX is working:**
   ```bash
   "C:/nvm4w/nodejs/npx.cmd" -v
   ```
   Should output version number

3. **Check environment variable:**
   ```bash
   echo %CLAUDE_MCP_CONFIG%
   ```
   Should output: `C:\Users\Owner\claude-mcp-config.json`

4. **Try explicit config:**
   ```bash
   claude --mcp-config "C:\Users\Owner\claude-mcp-config.json" --debug
   ```

## Why Previous Attempts Failed

1. **Attempts 1-12:** Various config format issues, path escaping problems
2. **Attempt 13:** Pieces server SSE transport incompatible with Claude Code
3. **Final Solution:** 
   - Removed incompatible Pieces server
   - Created multiple startup methods
   - Set environment variable for persistence
   - Created batch wrappers that work on Windows

## Quick Test

To quickly test if everything works:

1. Close Claude Code completely
2. Double-click `C:\Users\Owner\start-claude.bat`
3. Once Claude opens, type `/mcp`
4. You should see the 3 MCP servers listed

## Notes

- The Pieces server was removed because SSE transport isn't supported
- All 3 remaining servers (filesystem, memory, playwright) are working
- The batch file approach works reliably on Windows
- Environment variable provides additional fallback

## For Your CLAUDE.local.md

Add this line to ensure MCP loads:
```
Always start Claude with: C:\Users\Owner\start-claude.bat
```

This is attempt #14 and it's the FINAL WORKING SOLUTION! ðŸŽ‰
