# MCP Fixed for Claude Code CLI - 2025-08-22

## Solution Applied
Updated `C:\Users\Owner\claude-mcp-config.json` to include all 4 MCP servers:
1. ✅ filesystem - for file operations
2. ✅ memory - for knowledge graph 
3. ✅ playwright - for browser automation
4. ✅ pieces - SSE transport (was already there)

## How to Start Claude Code with MCP Servers

You need to start Claude Code with the `--mcp-config` flag:

```bash
claude --mcp-config "C:\Users\Owner\claude-mcp-config.json"
```

## What Was Wrong
The config file at `C:\Users\Owner\claude-mcp-config.json` only had 2 servers (pieces and playwright). It was missing:
- filesystem server
- memory server

## Current Status
All 4 MCP servers are now configured in `C:\Users\Owner\claude-mcp-config.json`

## Next Time You Start Claude Code
Make sure to use:
```bash
claude --mcp-config "C:\Users\Owner\claude-mcp-config.json"
```

This will load all 4 MCP servers and you should have access to the mcp__ prefixed tools again.
