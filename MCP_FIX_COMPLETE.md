# MCP Fix Complete - 2025-08-22

## Problem Identified
The MCP filesystem server wasn't starting because it requires the allowed directory to be passed as a command-line argument, not just as an environment variable.

## Solution Applied
Updated `C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:
- Added `"C:\\Users\\Owner\\claude code projects"` as an argument to the filesystem server
- Removed the unused `FILESYSTEM_ROOT` environment variable

## Changes Made
```json
"filesystem": {
  "command": "C:\\nvm4w\\nodejs\\npx.cmd",
  "args": [
    "-y",
    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@2025.8.21",
    "C:\\Users\\Owner\\claude code projects"  // <-- Added this line
  ],
  "env": {
    "PATH": "C:\\nvm4w\\nodejs;C:\\Windows\\System32;C:\\Windows"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
1. **Restart Claude Desktop** to apply the configuration changes
2. The MCP servers should now start automatically
3. You can verify they're working by checking if the MCP tools appear in Claude

## Verification
After restart, the filesystem MCP server should provide tools like:
- mcp__filesystem__read_file
- mcp__filesystem__write_file
- mcp__filesystem__list_directory
- etc.

The server has been tested manually and responds correctly with the new configuration.
